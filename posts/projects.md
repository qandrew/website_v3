Here are some projects I worked on from school and previous jobs. Apparently this is my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E0mN8P0AAAAJ).

- **Using Computer Vistion to Evaluate Scooter Parking**. Work at Lime building a CV model to detect whether a scooter is parked in compliance with city regulations; [blog post](https://medium.com/lime-eng/using-computer-vision-to-evaluate-scooter-parking-9979a1c3d685).
- **Dynamic pricing with Bayesian Updates from Online Reviews**. Joint work with Jose Correa, Mathieu Mari. Accepted to *2020 NeurIPS Workshop on ML for Economic Policy*. Paper is [here](https://www.di.ens.fr/~mmari/content/papers/Multi_Armed_Bandits.pdf).
- **Thresholdizing Lattice-Based Encryption Schemes**. Thesis for Masters of Engineering (2018), available [here](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/121688/1102057800-MIT.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).
<!-- - **Implementation of a Practical Leakage-Resilient ID Scheme**. Senior Year SuperUROP project.  -->
- **3D Tic Tac Toe AI**: I built a 3D Tic Tac Toe AI with a capacitive touch-based input for my Microcomputer Project Laboratory (6.115, Spring 2016) final project. Here is the [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5vISL8aN4Q) and the [Lab Notebook](https://github.com/qandrew/6.115-final-project/blob/master/Lab%20Notebook/Lab%20Notebook.pdf).
