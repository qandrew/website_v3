*Foreword: Recently on top of my mind has been [a climbing accident on Mt. Shasta in June 2022](https://www.sfchronicle.com/travel/article/Perfect-storm-on-Mount-Shasta-leaves-guide-17225281.php) which claimed the life of guide Jillian Webster. My condolences are to the guide who passed away and her family, and all other climbers injured. The outdoors can bring memories to keep for a lifetime --both good and bad --and it's always important to respect the mountain and stay safe.*

All things come to and end, and here is my wrap up post for the 2021-2022 Ski Season.

## Statistics

**Days** Overall I completed 31 days on the mountain, a personal record for me (beating my 2014-15 season consisting of 30 days on the mountain). This was my first year owning a touring setup, and my skiing days were split as follows: 1 day of XC skiing, 20 days in-resort, 12 days backcountry, with 2 days of both backcountry and in-resort.

**Turns All Year** Originally I wanted to go for Turns All Year, the idea of skiing every month of the year. I got a head start on this project kicking off the season in late October in British Columbia. However, it ended up being a dry winter in California and I threw in the towel in late May, realizing that I had other priorities for the summer months. Nonetheless my ski season spanned 8 months, definitely a new record for me!

**Backcountry Skiing** Through 11 tours, I covered 81 miles and 38,000 vertical feet in four states (CA, NV, OR, WA) and one Canadian province (BC).
Skiing the Ski Dreams line off of Matterhorn Peak (11mi, 5100ft) was a huge challenge for me, and I'm thankful that Rory, Kyle, and others showed me around that day. The hardest day for me was Shasta C2C (12mi, 7200ft) representing the high water mark in both elevation and elevation gain --the epitomy of type II fun.

Following Shasta, touring Helens and Hood in May were much more pleasant and in my fitness range.

## Takeaways

- Turns All Year is not worth it in California in a low-tide year. If you live in San Francisco, the ~4 hour drive up to Tahoe is quite costly and tiring. Maybe I'll need to wait for El Nino sometime.
- Car Camping is underrated. For my May ski adventures in the PNW, most of them were done by sleeping in the trailhead the night before. I felt much more energetic during the day compared to my Tahoe trips where some days began at 5am and involved driving for 4 hours before starting the tour. Driving is surprisingly tiring, which is both a blessing (if you drive the night before, it'll help you sleep better) and a curse (if you drive the day of, your tour will be tiring).
- Backcountry Skiing is a great way to meet new people and make friends! I met some people on the Facebook groups and really got along with people.
- What's next? For next ski season, I would love to do a ski traverse (Tahoe, Spearhead, etc). A Rainier C2C would be the dream, though weather will be harder to time as I do not live in the PNW.
