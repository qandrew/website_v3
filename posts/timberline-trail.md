Mt. Hood is a magical place. Every trip to Mt. Hood has been a special occasion for me. 

I visited Mt. Hood for the first time in August 2020, and seeing the hand-crafted artwork inside the Timberline Lodge was spectacular. In November 2021, we stayed two nights at the Timberline Lodge, where I did my first ever solo backcountry skiing runs (staying inside the resort terrain before the ski season began, it was safe). In May 2022 we [summitted](/posts/mt-hood) Mt. Hood through the Pearly Gates and skied down, which has been one of, if not, the most aesthetic lines I've skied.

Returning to the Pacific Northwest this summer, Wade and I wanted to make a road trip out of our primary objective, [riding Seattle to Portland](/posts/stp). We considered other activities we were both interested in (such as biking McKenzie pass, potentially summitting one of the Cascade volcanoes), and we decided on doing the Timberline Trail as it was the best option since we did not want to backpack and also wanted to avoid glaciated terrain.

### Training

Since run was done around the same time as when we trained for the Seattle to Portland bike ride, a lot of the aerobic endurance was achieved through long bike rides. One week before our road trip, we did a [20 mile trail run](https://www.strava.com/activities/11809717341) in the Mt. Tam watershed to test our running legs. Based on the run, we felt it was better to do Timberline Trail _after_ STP instead of our original plan of before, which turned out to definitely be the right call.

Though the Timberline trail is often done as a multi-day backpacking trip, we wanted to test the frontier of our endurance. The trail is approximately 40 miles long with 10,000 feet of vertical gain. I had done the [Cactus to Clouds hike](/posts/cactus-to-clouds) which is a 10,000 ft hike, and last summer I ran the [Broken Arrow skyrace](https://www.strava.com/activities/9285148031) in Tahoe, which was 25 miles / 8,5000 ft. I felt that extrapolating an extra 15 miles from my previously longest trail run would be reasonable.

### The Timberline Trail

We did dispersed camping near Trilium Lake the night before and after.

Prior to the hike, we had some decisions to make: 
<!-- TODO: better title -->
- *Where to start?* There are many trailheads with access to the Timberline Trail, however without question the best place to start and end is the Timberline Lodge, where you have good road access and a day lodge to use before the hike.
- *When to start?* As we had ridden Seattle to Portland two days before, we wanted to get enough sleep the night before, and as the summer days in the PNW are so long, we set a 4:30am alarm. We ended up starting the hike around 6am and finished at 10:30pm, with the last hour in the dark. In hindsight, starting a bit earlier would've been better.
- *Clockwise or Counter-Clockwise?* There are two orientations for doing the Timberline Trail. At first we thought clockwise would be better to minimize time in sun and heat. After chatting with my friend Chris who did the trail previously, he recommended going CCW since the section between Timberline Lodge and the white river is very sandy, and it would be much better to do it as a descent rather than ascent. Going CCW was definitely the right decision, mainly on this point.
- *Wilderness Permits* The Timberline Trail doesn't have a quota system, however hikers are asked to fill in wilderness permits. We couldn't find the forms to fill in at the Wy'East day lodge. However at the Cloud Cap trailhead (mile 15 CCW), Bald Mountain shelter (mile 26), and near the end of the trail (~mile 40) there were permit stations. This set up is not ideal for one-day CCW runners.

**Nutrition** We underestimated the 

Water is not an issue on the hike as there are many streams and snow (in July)

I ended up drinking 8L of water and eating 3-4000 calories.

**Gear** We brought hiking poles, which turned out to be critical for river crossings. I used iodine pills to filter water, but I would probably buy water filters so I don't need to carry extra water weight while the filter

The views on the Timberline Trail were absolutely spectacular.
