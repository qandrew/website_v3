### Training

For my CIM training plan, I followed a combination of the Boston Marathon 20 week training plan and also my running club (Nth Degree) Coach Mike's 8 week marathon build. As this was the third road marathon I've run, I wanted to take it more seriously with my training block. I aimed to run 6 days a week.

There were some interruptions in my training block (I went camping for a week in August, traveled for a month in October in Europe, and got sick for a week in October) but overall I am happy with the runs I put in. Below are some of the hightlights of my training block.

**July** I gave myself a 20 week training block, following the Boston Marathon schedule, which started after we got back from the Pacific Northwest having done the [Seattle to Portland](/posts/stp) bike ride and the [Timberline Trail](/posts/timberline-trail). My aerobic fitness at this point was pretty good; the marathon training cycle would focus on getting the speed needed to run fast.

Weekly Mileage (high is bolded): 30 miles, **41.3 miles**.

Training Highlights:

July 23: 8x800 Track workout

July 30: Track workout: 400, 800, 1200, mile, 1200, 800, 400

**August**

Weekly Mileage (high is bolded): 33 miles, 41.1 miles, **49.3 miles**, 6.4 miles.

Training Highlights:

Aug 6: 3 sets of (4x200, 200 recovery, mile ). I descended down to 36s for the 200s and 6:24 mile

Aug 8: 3x8min tempo workout, the last set was at 6:22 pace

Aug 13: 5x1200s, fastest was 4:46

Aug 18: 4mi warm up, 4x2mi @ MP (6:52, 6:48, 6:52, 6:43) with 2-3 minutes rest, cool down

Aug 20: Strawberry Hills workout for Nth Degree track practice

Aug 22: 5x1mi @ HMP (6:48, 6:56, 6:53, 7:04, 6:48)

Aug 24: 16mi tempo run

Lowlights: For the last week of August, I was camping so my mileage dipped a lot. This was basically a rest week which ate into my training, but alas is the balance between a running training plan and other commitments.

**September**

Mileage: 42.3 miles, **50.5 miles**, 35.5 miles, 50 miles.

Training Highlights: 



Lowlights: I didn't a lot of speed workouts during the first week of September as I was still recovering from the August camping trip. I ended up doing 12 mile long runs for some of the weekends due to fatigue or having a late night social commiment the night before. During this bulk period of the build, my mileage could have been higher but it means there is an easy area to improve for my next marathon.

**October**

Highest Mileage: 44.9 miles

I spent the month of October traveling in Europe. I was able to hold my mileage at a satisfying amount (I ran about 40 miles a week, even with all the travels), however I did fewer speed workouts as the travels and other social commitments made me more tired. I did make a conscious tradeoff of traveling, which compromised my overall marathon performance, but the life experiences I had in Europe were worth it.

### Training Supplementals

**Cadence** One thing I noticed about my running was that I entered the training block with a fairly low natural cadence of around 150.
As coach Mike noted, part of this could be due to the fact that I am tall (6'1) and coming from a cycling background, where because the legs are a single system on the bike with the down push of one leg helping the other leg recover upwards, this would translate to a lower running cadence.

I 

**Nutrition** Coach Mike recommended an average of 2 grams per bodyweight kilogram of protein every day. After each run I 

**Compromises** In this training cycle, I strived to find a balance between my social life at night and the long runs the next morning.

### The Timberline Trail

We did dispersed camping near Trilium Lake the night before and after.

Prior to the hike, we had some decisions to make:

<!-- TODO: better title -->

- _Where to start?_ There are many trailheads with access to the Timberline Trail, however without question the best place to start and end is the Timberline Lodge, where you have good road access and a day lodge to use before the hike.
- _When to start?_ As we had ridden Seattle to Portland two days before, we wanted to get enough sleep the night before, and as the summer days in the PNW are so long, we set a 4:30am alarm. We ended up starting the hike around 6am and finished at 10:30pm, with the last hour in the dark. In hindsight, starting a bit earlier would've been better.
- _Clockwise or Counter-Clockwise?_ There are two orientations for doing the Timberline Trail. At first we thought clockwise would be better to minimize time in sun and heat. After chatting with my friend Chris who did the trail previously, he recommended going CCW since the section between Timberline Lodge and the white river is very sandy, and it would be much better to do it as a descent rather than ascent. Going CCW was definitely the right decision, mainly on this point.
- _Wilderness Permits_ The Timberline Trail doesn't have a quota system, however hikers are asked to fill in wilderness permits. We couldn't find the forms to fill in at the Wy'East day lodge. However at the Cloud Cap trailhead (mile 15 CCW), Bald Mountain shelter (mile 26), and near the end of the trail (~mile 40) there were permit stations. This set up is not ideal for one-day CCW runners.

**Nutrition** We underestimated the difficulty of the hike, as I ate almost all of my food on the trail. Drinking water is not an issue on the hike as there are many streams and snow (in July). I ended up drinking 8L of water and eating 3-4000 calories.

**Gear** We brought hiking poles, which turned out to be critical for river crossings. I used iodine pills to filter water, but I would probably buy water filters so I don't need to carry extra water weight while the iodine pills process the water.

**The Trail** We started at 6am and headed in a counter-clockwise direction. Either way you head, you begin the trail with a descent (and end with an ascent).

There are multiple river crossings, and doing this trail in mid July was pretty challenging. The time of day affects the difficulty of the river crossing as snowmelt increases throughout daylight.

![photo {caption: A very picturesque campsite with a view of Mt. Adams}](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczPieSAuSXNOZqqRBj-lIvOIc10I2rfJl3S4LYe0pT2CP_TmUbrGKs7YCNtj07MEq4tVj9V39J07lJu3Hr6quabiw1VM0jdAy4CQDRRFRuMyTaIDKhDrLlRy1ys3uovytYjAo2YKriJJZhqOT2pu4lucbg=w2582-h1936-s-no-gm)

The east side of Mt. Hood is drier than the west side, as it sits in the mountain's rain shadow. You can notice the difference in flora, with drier plants on the east side which receives less snowfall in the winter. The trail reaches its peak elevation at about 7300ft around mile 13, shortly before the campsite in the photo above. We also took a slight detour off the Timberline trail to follow the Eliot Moraine trail, which follows the ridge of the moraine offering spectacular views of Mt. Hood's largest glacier.

Unfortunately climate change is real in 2024 and things are only getting worse. Reading [research papers](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-251/egusphere-2024-251.pdf) shows that the glacial loss in the first 20 years of the 21st century is almost the same amount as all of the 20th century.

We had lunch around the 21 mile mark. During the first half of the hike, we only encountered 8 people and 1 dog. We saw a total of 73 people and 3 dogs during the whole hike, as most people were seen during the second half. Most of Oregon's population is on the western side of Mt. Hood in the Willamette Valley, so maybe the trailheads are more popular towards the west.

The western portion of the hike is also at lower elevation in general, providing more shade which was very nice in the afternoon. The beauty of the Timberline Trail is in its diverity of climate and terrain, as we descended into more of a temperate rainforest.

Some parts of the trail were quite well maintained and popular, however there were also other parts with fallen trees that required some crawling and squatting to get around.

![photo](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczMSJYB_cPssn_1CIkamYTWuXHN4v_Ny0T2aBfmo0YEA_H9-LbFpk6oZEi4FBPl0vWvYEIdg-8sFvhPX9wUyBN4oK4ULfa5A4Mv43IXxQ0AaHIFzDQOBAkMEOGLZcCnJ9g7O_x7DHxEOPd7SM4IhvYT5qA=w1452-h1936-s-no-gm)

We reached Ramona Falls around 6pm, nearing the lowest elevation of the trail. The Sandy River Crossing turned out to be the hardest crossing of the day, as we crossed around the hottest time of the day. For most of the previous crossings, we could find rocks to step on so only our feet and shoes would get mildly wet (and would dry off in the following miles), but for this we could not find rocks and eventually committed to stepping into the bottom of the river, around an ankle high depth.

On a side note, hiking in wet shoes wasn't too uncomfortable, however I did get some blisters by the end of the hike due to my feet being wet. My shoes and socks also smelled horribly after the hike; I washed my shoes in the washing machine afterwards to clean the gear.

We reached our car at 10:30pm, exhausted but also feeling very accomplished! As our first times completing a 50k trail run, it felt very satisfying. I may have also opened the can of worms to do more trail runs. Maybe Rae Lakes will be next :)

The post from [HikingGuy](https://hikingguy.com/hiking-trails/pnw-hikes/timberline-trail-guide-mt-hood/) was very helpful.

Here is my [strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/11901473187/) recording. I would not fully recommend following this GPX track as we took some detours finding the river crossings.
