In the past, I dabbled fairly casually in video. Here are some projects I worked on, I'm not even sure if they are worth sharing:

- **6.854 Advanced Algorithms Lecture Videos**: In Spring 2016, I took Ankur Moitra's Advanced Algorithms class. With the help of my friends Sitara Persad and Shraman Ray Chaudhuri, we filmed all but two lectures. You can view the playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6ogFv-ieghdoGKGg2Bik3Gl1glBTEu8c).
- **6.875 Cryptography & Cryptanalysis Lecture Videos**: In Spring 2018, I took Vinod Vaikuntanathan and Shafi Goldwasser's [Cryptography](http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp18/6.875/) class. I filmed all but one lecture (oops I lost the video on MPC somwhere in the middle of class). You can view the playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6ogFv-ieghe8MOIcpD6UDtdK-UMHG8oH).
- **Hack Punt Tool, IAP 2017**: In January 2017, I supported MIT Student Cable with filming MIT Musical Theater Guild's showing of *Hack, Punt, Tool*, which is an original musical about a fictional group of MIT students working on building a Hack at MIT. The lenses we used included a Nikon 70-200mm f2.8 and a Panasonic 7-14mm f4.0. You can see the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPpqXyo4jhM).
- **Youtube** I occasionally also upload videos to my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBMRsvbl5-NcJ5dsIoY9ZcQ).
