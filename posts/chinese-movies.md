*January 2026* I've been feeling a bit nostalgic about Asia after traveling back there last December over the holidays. Having spent almost a bakers dozen in Asia growing up, splitting time between Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Beijing, every trip back always feels special.

I wanted to share some Chinese movies that I've especially enjoyed, and I will try to keep this list up to date

1. 活着 (To Live). 1994. This is my all time favorite movie in Chinese. It spans the turbulent history of China from the 40s to the 70s and captures the essence of the will to survive, the hardships of live, and the rapid change that China of my parents' and grandparents' generations went through. Every time I've watched this movie I've cried greatly.
1. 霸王别姬 (Farewell my Concubine). 1993. Another movie produced in the 90s, it is another historical drama in a similar "coming-of-cage" vien to *To Live*, depicting the changes of China (through the lens of Peking Opera) in the early 20th century.
1. 大象席地而坐 (An Elephant Sitting Still). 2019. Disclaimer: this is not a pleasant movie to watch, but it is a worthy life experience. This is a 4 hour movie set in 石家庄 which has been the best depiction of depression that I've seen.
1. 好东西 (Her Story). 2024. I recently watched this per recommendation through a friend and I'd agree with her view that it is a Chinese Flagship Movie. It's something I've never seen before (and it made it through Chinese censorship) in its witty humor and depiction of modern Chinese feminism, lesbian love, and other taboo topics.
1. 花樣年華 (In the Mood for Love). 2000. I watched this in undergrad for a film class, and I did not fully understand the beauty of love, music, and color in the movie. I've been meaning to do a re-watch, as it is highly rated.
1. 没完没了 (Sorry Baby). 1999. This is a light hearted comedy that I watched as a kid (cue in 傅彪's iconic "ok ok ok" line). I recently watched this on a China Southern flight out of China, and it felt way more nostalgic to watch it in hindsight, to see how much China has changed in the past quarter century in development, technology, and it's views on the west. It's in nice contrast to 好东西 to see how China has changed.

Some other movies I've enjoyed： 小城之春, 芳华, 山河故人, 地道战, The Last Emperor.
